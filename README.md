## AWS Lambda + Scala

A place to play with AWS lambda backed by the Scala programming language. 

Examples: 

1) `Main` class with `greeting()` handler that includes basic JSON parsing (e.g. a JSON document uploaded to S3 can be parsed).
2) `Handler` class with `handleRequest()` method that can service a simple JSON request via the AWS API Gateway.
